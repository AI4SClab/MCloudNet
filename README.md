# MCloudNet
## ðŸŒŸ **Overview**  
MCloudNet integrates **multi-layer satellite cloud images**, **ground-based meteorological data**, and **advanced deep learning techniques** to improve PV power prediction, particularly in **data-scarce rural micro-grids**. The framework effectively captures **cloud motion vectors, occlusion coefficients, and cloud layer interactions**, leading to superior forecasting accuracy and interpretability.
